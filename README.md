# Batter Spray Chart Analysis

This Shiny Application provides interactive visualization of batter spray charts for the 2024 MLB season.
Users can explore hit locations while analyzing the outcome and launch angle. 
Additionally the shiny application was styled with a "sketchy" theme to resemble the pencil and paper style of a 
baseball lineup card.
